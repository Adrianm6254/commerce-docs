Getting Started
===============

Drupal Commerce requires using Composer with Drupal. If you are new to
Composer, or new to managing Drupal with Composer, see :doc:`composer`.

To get Drupal Commerce installed, see the :doc:`install` guide.

For keeping Drupal Commerce up to date, review the :doc:`update` guide.
